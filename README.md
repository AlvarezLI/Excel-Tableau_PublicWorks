# Public Works Analysis in Argentina

## Project Description
This project focuses on the analysis of public works data in Argentina, using a dataset provided by the [Investment Map of the Ministry of Public Works](https://mapainversiones.obraspublicas.gob.ar/#OpenData). Using data analysis and visualization tools such as **Excel** and **Tableau**, the data was processed to obtain a comprehensive view of the geographical distribution and progress of public works, allowing for a deep understanding of investment trends and government priorities in infrastructure.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Processing and Analysis**: Cleaning, transformation, and validation of the data to ensure its accuracy.
2. **Data Visualization**: Clear and accessible presentation of the data through interactive charts and slicers.
3. **Obtaining Insights**: Identifying relevant patterns and generating answers to key questions about the distribution, progress, and types of public works.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, validation, and the creation of pivot tables and interactive dashboards.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards, advanced visual exploration, and effective communication of insights derived from the analysis.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Processing
   - **Cleaning and Validation**: In Excel, cleaning processes were performed to standardize data formats and verify the consistency of values. Qualitative data was validated using auxiliary lists, while quantitative data was checked directly in the table.
   - **Data Structuring**: The data was structured in a way that facilitated analysis both in Excel and Tableau, organizing it by categories such as type of work, progress status, province of location, and year of initiation.

### 2. Formulation of Key Questions (Excel)
   - What is the geographical distribution of public works in Argentina?
   - What are the most common types of projects?
   - What is the progress status of the projects, and how are they distributed by region and year?
   - Which provinces concentrate the largest number of works in progress or completed?

### 3. Analysis in Excel
   - **Pivot Tables and Slicers**:
      - Pivot tables were created to group and break down the information by different categories, such as type of project, status, and province.
      - Slicers were used to make exploring the data by specific criteria easier.
   - **Interactive Dashboard**:
      - An interactive dashboard was built in Excel with charts and linked slicers, allowing for quick and dynamic analysis of the status and distribution of projects.
      - Hyperlinks between sections of the file for intuitive and efficient navigation.
   
### 4. Visualization in Tableau
   - **Interactive Dashboards**:
      - A set of interactive dashboards was designed in Tableau to visually represent key data in an engaging and interactive manner.
      - Detailed analysis by province, project type, and progress status.
   - **Distribution Maps**:
      - Geographical visualization of the distribution of works across Argentina, helping identify regions with a higher concentration of projects.
   - **Temporal Analysis**:
      - Line and bar charts to examine the number of projects initiated and completed over the years.
   
## Key Results
- **Geographical Distribution**: A concentration of works in certain provinces was identified, which may indicate areas of focus for infrastructure investment.
- **Execution Status**: The analysis clearly visualized the percentage of completed, ongoing, and planned projects in each region.
- **Type of Projects**: Patterns in the most frequent types of projects were observed, showing the current priorities in terms of public investment.

## Visualization Guide
1. **Excel**:
   - Access the "Dashboard" sheet to interact with charts and slicers that allow data to be analyzed from different perspectives.
   - In "Tablas_Dinamicas" (Pivot Tables), you will find detailed pivot tables. (This sheet may be hidden to simplify navigation).
2. **Tableau**:
   - Navigate through the interactive dashboards for visual and dynamic analysis.
   - Use the filters for province, project type, and execution status to customize your exploration of the data.

## Conclusions
This analysis has provided an integrated understanding of public works in Argentina, allowing the identification of investment focal points and the progress of projects across the country. The combination of Excel and Tableau allowed for thorough data validation and effective visualization at different levels of detail.
